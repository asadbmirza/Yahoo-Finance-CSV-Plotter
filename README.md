# Yahoo-Finance-CSV-Plotter
Yahoo Finance Plotter takes in CSV data from Yahoo finance and provides a variety of functions such as share volume plotting, daily volume rate of change, and open/closing price comparisons! OOP project created utilizing matplotlib/Pandas on Python.

Need to implement/improve on
- Learning more about finance from learning resources to get a better idea of what new functions can be implemented
- Adding in functions that use machine learning which can predict future volume fluctuations, open/closing prices etc
- Adding in a GUI to better enhance casual user experience
